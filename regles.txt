   Welcome to FightMATCH

     Rules are simple
Get two identical warriors
     to get a MATCH !
Throw your warriors in the
arena to see your warrior's
value. If you roll a corpse
(or 1), you lose that warrior.
If you get a match, you get
    both warriors back !

After your first role, you
can rethrow or let the next
  player play. BE SMART !

If you match the only warrior
    in the arena, it's an
         ARENA SWEEP
The next player has to throw
   ALL their warriors in !
